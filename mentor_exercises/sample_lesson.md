# linear and logistic regression lessons

## Three questions I might expect from students
1. What is the difference between linear regression and logistic regression?
2. How do you choose a threshold for the logistic regression?
3. How do you choose the variables to be included in a linear regression?

## Questions I would ask to check on their understanding (relevant to questions above)
1. Do you understand the difference between continuous and categorical (or binary) variables?
2. How do you know if a variable should be included in a regression model?
3. Do you understand what the R^2 value signifies?

## An activity for the student
To better understand how the inclusion of different variables (or features) influences a regression model, add or deduct different variables from the model to look at the effect on the R^2. 

1. Does the R^2 increase or decrease as you add certain variables? 
2. If a model with more features has a higher R^2 than a model with less features, is it necessarily better?
3. What are more efficient ways to decide which variables to include in your regression model?
